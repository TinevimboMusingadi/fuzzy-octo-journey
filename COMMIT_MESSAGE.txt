feat: Implement Dynamic Intake Form Agent with LangGraph

Initial implementation of dual-mode intake form agent architecture:

Core Features:
- Dual-mode design: Speed mode (~50ms/turn) and Quality mode (~800ms/turn)
- Hybrid mode with intelligent mode switching
- Complete LangGraph implementation with 6 nodes:
  * ASK: Generate questions for form fields
  * PROCESS: Extract structured values from user input
  * VALIDATE: Validate extracted values
  * CLARIFY: Generate clarification requests
  * ANNOTATE: Detect and add notes to responses
  * ADVANCE: Move to next field with conditional logic

Implementation Details:
- FormState type definition with TypedDict
- Speed mode: Template-based questions, regex extraction, rule validation
- Quality mode: LLM-powered generation and validation
- Comprehensive validation system for all field types
- Conditional field display logic
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

Testing:
- 71 unit tests covering all components
- Tests for validation, modes, nodes, utils, and graph
- All tests passing
- pytest configuration included

Project Structure:
- src/: Core implementation
- tests/: Comprehensive test suite
- Configuration management with AgentConfig
- Interactive demo in main.py
- Documentation in README and QUICKSTART

Dependencies:
- LangGraph >= 0.2.0
- LangChain >= 0.3.0
